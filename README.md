# LSMCP - Language Server Protocol MCP

An experimental Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation that provides AI models with access to Language Server Protocol (LSP) capabilities.

## Overview

This project creates an MCP server that communicates with LSP servers, enabling AI models to access code intelligence features like auto-completion, go-to-definition, find-references, and other language-specific capabilities.

## Status

âœ… **Container-Ready** - The project now runs in Docker containers for cross-platform compatibility.

## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Build the container:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/depoll/lsmcp.git
   cd lsmcp
   npm run docker:build
   ```

2. **Configure your MCP client** to use the `lsmcp` server from `.mcp.json`

3. **The container will:**
   - Mount your working directory at `/workspace`
   - Provide pre-installed language servers for TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, etc.
   - Automatically detect project languages and provide code intelligence

### Development Setup

For development and testing:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit        # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration # Integration tests only
npm run test:efficiency  # Efficiency benchmarks

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Features

- **6 Combined MCP Tools** for efficient code intelligence:
  - `navigate` - Definition, implementation, and type navigation
  - `getCodeIntelligence` - Hover info, signatures, and completions
  - `findSymbols` - Document and workspace symbol search
  - `findUsages` - References and call hierarchy
  - `applyEdit` - Code actions, rename, format with transactions
  - `getDiagnostics` - Errors, warnings, and quick fixes

- **Container-First Architecture**:
  - Eliminates Windows compatibility issues
  - Safe automatic language server installation
  - Consistent environment across platforms

- **Zero-Config Language Support**:
  - Automatic language detection
  - Pre-installed language servers
  - Support for 10+ programming languages

## Supported Languages

- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Python
- Go
- Rust
- Java
- C/C++
- Ruby
- PHP
- And more...

## Architecture

The system runs inside a Docker container with:
- Your workspace mounted at `/workspace`
- Language servers pre-installed and configured
- Automatic language detection and connection pooling
- Health monitoring and crash recovery

## Development

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for detailed development instructions and architecture overview.
