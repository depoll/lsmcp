# LSMCP - Language Server Protocol MCP

An experimental project for building an MCP (Model Context Protocol) for the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

## Overview

This project aims to create an MCP implementation that can communicate with LSP servers, potentially enabling AI models to access code intelligence features like auto-completion, go-to-definition, find-references, and other language-specific capabilities.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development** - This project is in the early stages of development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (tested on 18.x, 20.x, and 22.x)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/depoll/lsmcp.git
cd lsmcp
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Run in development mode with hot reloading
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit        # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration # Integration tests only
npm run test:efficiency  # Efficiency benchmarks

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build
```
