# ðŸš¨ QUICK FIX for Current Errors

## TL;DR
**The errors you're seeing are normal for a project without dependencies installed.**

**Solution:** Run `npm install` and all errors will disappear.

## What's Happening

You're seeing these errors because:

1. **`eslint: not found`** - ESLint isn't installed yet
2. **`prettier: not found`** - Prettier isn't installed yet  
3. **`Cannot find module 'pino'`** - Dependencies aren't installed yet
4. **`Cannot find name 'process'`** - @types/node isn't installed yet

## The Fix

```bash
npm install
```

**That's it.** After installation:
- âœ… ESLint and Prettier will be available
- âœ… All TypeScript types will be found
- âœ… All development commands will work
- âœ… The post-edit-check hook will pass

## Verification

After running `npm install`, you can verify everything is working:

```bash
npm run validate-setup  # âœ… Checks if all tools are available  
npm run type-check      # âœ… Should pass without errors
npm run lint            # âœ… Should run ESLint successfully
```

## Why This Happened

This is a **normal state** for a Node.js project before dependencies are installed. The configuration is correct - it just needs the actual packages to be downloaded.

## Files Already Fixed

- âœ… `package.json` - All required dependencies listed
- âœ… `tsconfig.json` - Properly configured for Node.js + ESM
- âœ… All tool configurations are ready

**Just run `npm install` and you're done! ðŸŽ‰**
